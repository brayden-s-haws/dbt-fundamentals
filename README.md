# dbt Fundamentals

#### Current status: Complete

___

### Personal Progress
* What I learned: How to use dbt the right way. I had been using it for about 2 years at work through trial and error.
* What I wish I had done differently: Applied the learnings to a project of my own. I intended to keep using this in my day job but then changed jobs. I should have found a side project to apply the learnings.
* What I want to learn next: More about how Jinja python works. Jinja is the core of dbt and you can do a lot in dbt without really understanding how it works. But it does become a barrier as you want to implement more advanced functionality.

## Description
This was the work for a course I did to learn dbt.
